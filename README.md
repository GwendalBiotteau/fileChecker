# File Checker <small>by [Gwendal BIOTTEAU](https://www.gwendalbiotteau.fr)</small>
I created this short Python script initially to help a friend who has a specific need. On his computer, he has a folder with a lot of music files but a lot of music were duplicated but with different names (similar but different) so he wanted to analyze the folder and delete all the duplicated files. I coded this short Python script to solve this problem, so by running the `dist/fileChecker.exe` you must select a folder to analyze on your computer and then enter a number (between 1 and 100) which correspond to the percentage match for to file names.

The file `fileChecker.py` contain the script I wrote to do this if you want to check and tell me what do you think about this, or give me some advices or some possible upgrades !
